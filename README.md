## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a mini financial-analysis pipeline in Python using two real datasets: **Balance_Sheet.xlsx** and **Income_Statement.xlsx**. The goal is to combine, clean, and analyse company financials to help a hedge-fund manager understand performance across industries. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🧠 What the Project Does
- Loads and processes financial data from two separate Excel files  
- Merges balance-sheet and income-statement data into one analysis-ready DataFrame  
- Calculates key financial ratios:
  - **Gross profitability ratio** (gross margin)
  - **Leverage ratio** (debt-to-equity)
- Uses **pivot tables** to compare profitability and leverage across industry types (tech, FMCG, real estate)
- Performs a focused analysis on the real-estate sector to see whether higher leverage correlates with higher profitability
- Generates a **regression plot** showing a positive relationship between leverage and profitability for real-estate companies (page 3 of the PDF) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Data cleaning & merging** using pandas  
- **Financial ratio computation** (profitability & leverage)  
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with pivot tables  
- **Visualisation** using seaborn regression plots  
- **Industry-level comparison** and interpretation of financial metrics  
- **End-to-end workflow**: loading → merging → analysis → insights  

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The project replicates a realistic financial-analysis task: preparing ratios for cross-industry comparison and visualising risk–return patterns. It demonstrates your ability to use Python for practical finance-focused analytics that support decision-making.
